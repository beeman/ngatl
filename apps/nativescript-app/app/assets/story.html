          <p><h2>ngAtlanta: The origin story</h2>
<p>It's really amazing how the birth of a child can change someone. As much as I've loved the birth of all of my children it was my daughter's birth that changed me the most. Her birth gave me a new speech filter. Before I speak I wonder if I would want someone to say this about my daughter or to my daughter. She also gave me a stronger desire to try and make the industry I work in, software, more welcoming and inclusive for her. I know some people will read this and think "oh great another 'As a father of daughters'" post or that it shouldn't take a man having a daughter to become less sexist. Both of these statements are 100% correct. It's also true to say that it shouldn't take having a sister or a wife for someone to respect women more either. My wife and daughter did not create my desire to make the software industry more inclusive, they did, however inspire me to be a more vocal and proactive ally.</p>

<h3>It started with a drive</h3>

<p>A drive back from a family vacation in April 2017 to Savanna Georgia to be exact. I was in the only one awake, my wife (pregnant with baby number 4 at the time) and 3 children were sleeping. I looked in the rear view mirror at my daughter and got to thinking. The teams I lead at work tend to have very high percentages of women in technology on them, I try my best to be an ally and promote women in technology both visibly on social media and behind the scenes. However there was one thing I couldn't help but realize. What I was doing only was within my small sphere of influence. While I feel I was doing something good, it wasn't enough.</p>


<h3>How could I do more?</h3>
<p>I thought about tech conferences, specifically Angular conferences, what if there was an Angular conference that had 50% of the speakers be women in technology. That would be really hard to do, or so I thought. The rest of the drive home I continued to contemplate running a conference, the more I thought the more excited I became. In the dead of night, alone in my thoughts, I decided to put everything on the line pull the trigger. I'm going to organize a conference!</p>

<h3>Humble beginnings</h3>
<p>The goal was set, 50% female speakers, it was specific, measurable and intentional. The next day it started, I decided to start the only way I knew, Twitter. Direct messages were my first approach. I started to reach out to amazing female speakers that I had seen in person or on YouTube. I openly shared what it was I was trying to do and it resonated. Initially I was only planning a single day conference, it took me 3 days to fill that single day with 85% female speakers.</p>

<h3>Go big or go home</h3>
<p>One day really was too easy. I decided to grow the conference and see how big we could make it. Two full days and two days of workshops. A new goal was set, maintain at least 50% of the speakers being women in tech but try to get 50% of the attendees to be women. Things started to get real when I picked the venue, it was still under construction, the brand new Hotel at Avalon. We would be their first tech conference and one of the first conferences in the brand new space.</p>


<h3>A passion project</h3>
<p>Mike Brocchi asked me on Angular Air how I can organize this conference. It's a ton of work organizing a conference and I'm doing it while also working full time, there must be something motivating me. If I'm honest the time he asked the question was probably one of the hardest times along this journey. I was struggling with depression, severe impostor syndrome and it seemed like the conference was not growing. I answered with the truth. I wanted to be able to look at my daughter, show her this conference and be able to say, I tried my best to make it better.</p>

<h3>The fear factor</h3>
<p>For those who have organized a conference before you understand where this is going. There is a pretty strong fear factor that comes with organizing a conference. The financial aspects of running a conference are pretty intense. When the costs are multiples of your annual income every day is a struggle to stay focused and not let yourself be overcome by the fear. Don't get me wrong, I would never take this experience back.</p>

<h3>Why single track</h3>
<p>One of the questions I've been asked several times is why we decided to go single track. For me it was very simple, I want to give every one of the speakers the same opportunity to shine and have their voice heard. When you go multiple tracks you split the audience. This not only makes it so the audience misses a percentage of the content but it also gives the presenters a split audience.</p>

<h3>Don't go it alone</h3>
<p>I've had amazing volunteers like Angel Banks and Jeff Lu help a ton with ngAtlanta. Our speakers have been so incredibly helpful along the way as well. The biggest mistake I made along this journey though was not hiring a professional event planner sooner. Last week I decided to hire ZeroSlope events. Hiring them has allowed me the opportunity to focus on my passion, getting the word out about the conference.</p>
