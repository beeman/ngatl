          <h3>The Quick Version</h3>
          <p>ngAtl is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity
         and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack
         thereof), financial status, political views, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
         in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties,
         Twitter and other online media. ngAtl participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference
         without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
          <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>
          <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
         disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, financial status, political views, technology
         choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
         sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants
         asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment
         policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including
         volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment. If a
         participant engages in harassing behavior, ngAtl organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning
         the offender or expulsion from ngAtl with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
         or have any other concerns, please contact a member of ngAtl conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges. ngAtl staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
         security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for
         the duration of the conference. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at conference
         and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
          <h2>How do we handle Code of Conduct Violations</h2>
          <h3>Who gets involved?</h3>
          <p>The organizers and a committee of speakers will be called upon to consider each reported violation.</p>
          <h3>Initial Actions</h3>
          <p>When a violation occurs the committee will:</p>
          <ul>
         <li>Contact you via you're preferred method of contact immediately to ensure your safety</li>
         <li>Find a private place to talk</li>
         <li>Collect information on the offending party, what was said and/or done, who else was involved (if anyone), and the name
        of any witnesses (if any), as well as when and where the violation occurred. Follow up questions may be required depending
        on the situation.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Follow Up</h3>
          <p>Once we have the initial report the committee will discuss next steps. Depending on the severity of the violation the committee
         may report the incident to the police. If the committee is reasonably certain that the police are not required all of
         the following will happen:</p>
          <ul>
         <li>We will find the offender(s), let them know that a complaint was received, we will also hear their side of the story.</li>
         <li>We will immediately meet as a committee to decide response or what additional parties need to be involved, then decide
        a response.</li>
         <li>Carry out the response.</li>
         <li>We may address the conference and the community depending on the violation, letting them know that something happened
        that violated our code of conduct and that we addressed the issue.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
